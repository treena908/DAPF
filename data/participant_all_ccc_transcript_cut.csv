14,14,261,140,"   do you like to read?   yeah, me too. thats a very big part of my life.   mmm hmm. and yes and theres so many great books left that i have found from people that recommend.   yes. because you dont  if you dont like one theres always another one and you didnt spend any money.   yes. i do that too.   i used to belong in the book club and havent found one here yet, but that was fun because they were all from different backgrounds, different ages so they brought something into the table.   yeah. i think, yeah, go to the library i think is best or or just word of mouth, you know, people you know socially that are inclined to do it. there is a group in the library where i go at, west ashley center and library, but i havent been to it yet. been a little lazy.   thats right. thats very true. and ihave met some of those old acquaintances just by chance.   yes. so, thateven without making an effort i did establish some of the old friendships.   yeah, i went to a concert with tony at the piccolospoleto. i dont you know if you ever been?   and we went to this church to they sent to a woman who was one of my students and she plays the violin and her husband who is a conductor theyre right next to me was an old student and she couldnt believe it either.   then another one very similar just walked into a store and that is another friend for eternal. and then i went back to a place where i was working previously, of course i knew a lot of people that are students that live in the community so they remember me and they became friends.   it was a nonprofit organization.   and they didnt provide any of that.   so, all my health coverage is still my husband who works for   no, not the conyou mean for medical?   yes, well i didnt get i get the information from friends. i got the coverage through him.   thats another consideration about healthcare though is that i do not have any dental coverage which is very expensive.   yeah.   well i have to pay three hundred dollars per year   for just cleaning so sometimes its for two   if youre lucky or one and a dental xray, but no additional work. they will not fully pay   yeah. at m u s c. but they have branches near us actually. i go as little as possible.   yeah.   yes.   do you walk?",1,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
15,15,262,140,"   because after i used to work in insurance and then i was, i saw in ad in the paper about training for english as a second language so i started learning it and of course i took and finished and i loved that so i started in syracuse, new york and there i had a different method, it was one on one.   and then, when i came here, of course i looked that up and i found them and here it was, it was one tutor works with several students so its more effective.   yeah, thats one of the things i do teach.   well, i have one class especially and thats high intermediate to advanced so my new they are affiliate of m u s c. they were spouses of uh medical students.   and so they didnt have to learn that, but they still have to learn many other aspects of the healthcare system in the united states.   yes. because in most, and we always talk about different countries and their health providers and how it works and its very different.   but, in uh, my other class in north charleston, they are low beginners so they just starting to learn the language which makes it very difficult to clearly discuss anything because they just learning the words. but, there are some good uh, free programs in charleston for people that cant afford healthcare and one of them is through our lady of mercy on johns island.   they have a clinic for all immigrants. they dont care if theyre legal or not legal. they give dental as well as physical exams. and just last week, there was a free clinic in charleston to test all students for uh, aids.   because the incidents of incidence of aids went up from eight to eighteen percent in one year and most hispanics. so, there are programs out there to help.   it has a big impact and you know i mean each individual what we had just heard that story about longevity.   you know in classes and that it was studied and its an actual report and thirty percent genetics and seventy percent lifestyle. so, a lifestyle of course is uh, how you choose to live your life andhow you feel about life. but, it isnt completely a choice, for some people have to live a certain way and they dont have as many choices as others. but, regardless of your income or where you live, you can be more optimistic or concerned that with people and things that you like being around.   dont you think.   but   yes.   mmm hmm.   yes. and how much do you take?",1,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
16,16,263,140,"   well i see you are a cheerful person too. thats good. i think thats a big plus.   mmm hmm. i have a book upstairs you should read. i should show it to you.   actually it was promoted by oprah.   eckhart tolle. tolle   and, it is about the choices you make in your thinking like if they were positive and how you can rechannel it and live in the present rather than the past or the future and worry less and live more and enjoy more. its a lot more to it, but   so, not something that you can live it every single moment, but it can help you or help some people to do it that way.   mmm hmm.   mmm hmm.   yes, thats not easy to find. i think to find the right physician is very difficult.   i am okay, but not exalt him.   i love my dentist.   but, i, you know ive only lived here a year and a half so i asked acquaintances but, this one is just also it has to be someone that accepts medicare.   so, you when you move to a new place, you havenot all physicians will take medicare patients.   yeah.   well, thats is a soul question because my husband interviewed one and he went and said im moving here and i would like to find a new physician for myself, my wife, and my fatherinlaw. and, so he juggled with the doctor for a few minutes and thats all and then he received their bill for two hundred and fifty dollars. which he didnt want to pay, but m u s c kept sending him the bill which we didnt feel that was right and then m u s c report that they dont have such a policy that you just get that with a physician, so he paid it.   he was very upset about it, actually.   yes. for just chatting. because, i mean anyone from a plumber to a contractor will come and give you an estimate and your choice of physician is one of the most important choices you make. so, you should be able to to mull them over.   but, he was not informed that it will be a office visit.   yes.   no, nothing.   yes.   right, especially when you, you know you just cant jump around because you are limited in the number of visits you can even make.   yeah. i knew most doctors are okay,",1,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
17,17,264,140,"   its all right.   be glad too.   okay.   okay.   uh huh.   yes, uh huh.   i have. mmm.   convenient.   thats a full day.   and weekends are a little less busy, right?   do you? oh, okay. no beach time?   um, you reward yourself. okay, then my day, this will be our home, okay? i also get up at seven a.m. and the first thing i do is uh go for a forty minute walk in the neighborhood every day.   and.   by myself. yeah, its very safe and i usually take my ipod so the music inspires me to walk a little faster so then i walk all over, as you see, its a maze. i, i have two different routes, unfortunately there is no more than two. that is west ashley park behind us but we have to drive there in order to walk so i just stay here if i walk in the morning and then i come home. i prepare breakfast.   so i come back home.   i feel like it and around eight, eight thirty, we have breakfast, then uh, i will read the paper and i have other chores to do and to say exactly every days the same, it is not because three times a week i volunteer as an english as a second language tutor, so this is on tuesdays and thursdays and then i have also some social life and i visit my stepfather in assisted living facility and so we only usually two meals a day, one in the late afternoon and im usually the cook although sometimes we go out.   and uh and then we also work out in i do aerobics and swimming. and   yeah, he likes swimming. i dont like to work out on the machines. do you?   i do too. yeah.   i tried that. its, i do it more, i dont do it by myself.   if i have somebody else to it then its very relaxing.   but i like the activity,   i like the aerobic section the best.   does she.   um.   its fun i think doing coordination with others.   it gives you more of an incentive to be part of it and i like socializing anyway so",1,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
18,18,265,140,"   so this is basically how it goes and then well go walk on the beach or we go to some place or concerts or traveling.   visit my children, grandchildren and then see from friends here or parties so basically this is the main concept of my day.   the first time i started taking medications was six months ago when we moved back to charleston.   i didnt take anything although uh, in my family genetically my mother also had high cholesterol.   but she lived to be over ninety so and she didnt take any statins or any, only thing she took was a very low dose of blood pressure medication in her late eighties.   so i wasn?t too concerned about it but when my stepfather lived with us it was very stressful for me because i took care of him and he needed a lot of mental care basically and it, it required a lot of patience so then when i went to a visit to the doctor my blood pressure was high enough that he advised me to start taking medications so i dont have a stroke. so i started on a half a milligram of benazepril and ten milligrams of lipitor, which i take now. and, also i take some vitamins and calcium.   i think exercise will help you. what i would like to do is just naturally control it but i tried that before and actually but what i feel is the doctors dont have enough time to spend with each patient to get indepth information about the patients needs. they are kind and i know they have reasons why they cant allow more time, probably ten minutes maximum per patient so this is very restricted for them and, of course, some patients are more informed in their questions to get the right answers and others just go along with whatever the doctor will advise them and that makes a difference but really i think its changing. right now as people become more informed by journals and the internet, they ask more questions and they are more informed about what they need to do and how to take care of themselves and i still believe that you are your own best doctor first.   no, not in the past because i never frequented time at a physicians, my only caretaker is a physician was my gynecologist who was also the obstetrician, and he would check my blood pressure and give me whatever i needed if i needed anything so i didnt go frequently to the physician until i turned sixty five. i had my first uh, physical, complete physical because you get one when youre sixty five on medicare.",1,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
19,19,266,140,"   uh, keeping my uh blood pressure under control and it takes, we adjusted to lower dose and keeping physically fit and eating healthy foods which i try, not one hundred percent but its we try to, eat vegetables and fruits and not always uh, oatmeal but its not bad.   but i also believe in natural foods versus for a long time i used hydrogenated margarines and then it came to light that it wasnt so good. and i always ate butter and i believe in natural foods rather than manufactured additives that put on to preserve the foods so i think its important to  to do that and buy fresh fruits. i know some people, i worked too, which was very unusual and we had my two daughters. and my husband was laid off. i had to go back to work and but so when you were work and youre also raising children theres the pressure to balance it all and have time for everything but still if you really try you can make the time to eat more of the right foods and less of the prepared foods and also do exercise and keep your mind open and uh to be healthy in older age i think it is important to have friends, have interests and have social support.   that really helps.   it was very difficult because uh, when we decided to do it when we moved back to charleston he was still living on his own. my mother died. she was older. and she died four years prior to that so he was living by himself but we saw the decline but he just two months before we moved he was still driving a car and he lived close to us and i had to supervise him but he could, he was able to take care of his needs and once we moved here he became incontinent. he got completely confused and i think part of that was moving to a new house.   but also it was a stage of his dementia. he became weaker so it put a lot of stress on me because i tried, i encouraged him to retain as much as possible of his mind and his intellect but it was almost impossible. and i tried to do exercise with him mentally to remember things and he liked to walk and all those things too and he did all his life but he just couldnt do it.   so, my husband saw the stress it put on me and we discussed and decided we had no choice. so, yeah, it was very hard.   yes, and uh it is very hard to be a caretaker with people with dementia. its much more difficult than having your own illness.",1,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
20,20,267,140,"   yeah, even to ninety i think its remarkable.   this is one thing they have to research is dementia, alzheimers prevention and i also feel that, that there are too many discoveries in some ways to keep other people alive longer which also puts a burden on society because many people are really not enjoying life as much as they should but they are still kept alive by artificial means and there comes a time when its more of a burden than a pleasure so i dont necessarily believe that the longer life means a better life.   i think the quality of life is more important to me.   so, i feel that should be more of a concern and should be more concentrated than how long you live but how you live your life.   yes.   oh. uh huh.   yes. you know its pretty common i guess and thats interesting because my stepfather, his name is nick.   and he remembers everybodys name and, of course, longterm memory is good and short memory is lost but you say something to him yesterday or today   and its gone in five minutes. its very typical.   yeah. and uh, so i think you ask people over eighty five or ninety and if i say less than ten percent are happy to still be alive and enjoy life a lot and the other really just that because they dont know what else to do.   it just happens to them.   my future? i dont uh, worry about that too much. i live more in the present. i dont think about what will happen to me ten or fifteen or twenty years from now although i would not like to be in a situation to go an assisted living either. i would like to live independent place as long as i can and hopefully somebody will be there to take care of me.   so, yeah. uh, im not saying a hundred percent i wouldnt do but i would not want to.   yeah, i think its better to live under, on your own and pass away under natural circumstance that you will need some assistance.   well yes.   uh huh. it can happen to anybody but i dont, its not something thats on my mind constantly because i feel i take the steps necessary to prevent as much as i can by being active and challenging my mind as well as my body and trying to, i want to enjoy what im doing but at the same time keeping a balance, and thats all i can do and whatever happens happens so its not something thats im focused on.   its more immediate things, you know.",1,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
21,21,268,140,"   well for me it was hard because my mother lost my father when i was only four years old.   so i grew up in budapest, and she had to go to work and i was on my own, and uh, we didnt have very much money or anything, and food was scarce. i had many relatives and i would visit a different one almost every day after school.   until my mom got home and uh, as gro as i was growing up, it was, i had a great mother. she was very affectionate and fun and uh just had a big, a great big heart. everybody loved her and she had eight brothers and sisters but after the war only, four of them died so, and some lost husbands in world war ii so she was one of them. and she also lost her father so that part was very sad but at the time it was a nice family environment and at that time in hungary it was socialized medicine so you really didnt need very much so  when we had to we went to the doctor but maybe it helped us today because the we eat a lot less food than people do growing up in the u s a so maybe it helped us and we walked a lot and stayed physically active. there were no cars. we didnt have a phone or television so our time was spent with other people or being outside and i think that helps you. i think it is probably similar in brazil, it?s maybe not now but maybe in your parents life.   so, and then when i came to the united states i was very happy because i had two uncles that lived in new york so it was an exc i was sixteen and it was an exciting time for me. and, i m very glad that i did.   yeah, i like europe but i think its a better country to live. people are more broadminded and patient, in fact, nothing is perfect. so most, as far as the health care, i think uh there are some shortcomings and i also believe that everybody should have a right to healthcare other than some people being left out.   so i feel sorry for the ones that just are not able to get it and they dont have insurance and its shrinking because less and less companies are able to subsidize the health care for their employees so that means more and more people are left out and the very poor get covered and, of course, the wealthy people dont have to be concerned about it.",1,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
22,22,269,140,"   so, yes i was disappointed because i dont feel i got the time, something was wrong and this happens to because doctors don?t always know what is causing problem. so what i had to do was focus on myself and i willed myself to get better. and i did, i tried different. i was not, it had to nothing to do with nerves, i know that for sure because im not the nervous type and there was nothing going on in my life that would have caused this so it had nothing to do with emotions but it took me over a year to get over it. it was horrible.   very strange. so since then i wont get that tetanus booster.   no not shivery, my, it was maybe, it was not epilepsy but when people have epilepsy their whole body   not tensed up, no, it just your whole body is involved in a tremor.   but its not uh, parkinsons disease or anything like that or ms, which i know, has similar symptoms so they had no idea what caused it, none of them.   and they still dont know.   i just know i wont get a tetanus. yeah, one of those. there are many i guess but its not that they didnt care, i guess maybe they were just puzzled.   the physicians. but i did receive the medical care. they just didnt know how to deal with it.   i went about six times.   yeah, i didnt go from doctor to doctor, no. then i just decided i have to do it myself.   and you know i just read different articles and sort of hypnotized myself into being well and it worked, slowly. i lost about twenty pounds.   um hmm. but hopefully it never comes back but i know theres such a thing as panic attacks too which i didnt, it wasnt that either because i had a niece who had that and nobody believed her either and she experienced it, its funny that sometimes doctors, especially in the past many times male doctors have that womans problems a lot of times are in the mind or in the emotions.   it was, not just here. its international culture, yeah.   i, you know, i wasnt talked down to but uh, i think it was just assumed that it must be nerve related or an emotional problem just because. it wasnt like i started shaking because i was scared or i felt anxiety, which i explained so,",1,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
23,23,270,140,"   there is a lot of things to learn.   uh huh.   yes. thats very important, and you can learn from everybody, doesnt, its not only the more educated or the more technically knowledgeable that you should listen to because everybody has something to give you that you can learn from, anybody. you know. you learn something from everybody.   and i was lucky enough in teaching english as a second language to many people from all over the world and have a little peek into the cultures and how different nations will look at health issues. you know about china and they have such a huge problem with only being able to have one child per family and then they penalize you if you have a second one, you know, compared to that, i know they have a huge population problem but still when you look at an individual family its very traumatic for many mothers and fathers so to deal with that is much more and we are lucky to live in a country that still allows a lot of freedom.   yeah, so. would you like to know anything else?   with my   just the one i told you which was a pretty big one one i    yeah, its been, this was  oh thirty five years ago   i think.   no, no so i dont think its any uh major illness. i have no idea what it is, maybe it was some kind of a virus which you hear a lot about and wonder about what more viruses are coming to the surface. i have talked to friends that have problems with lately losing their smell and hearing and taste. have you heard that? i have two friends that lost, and one of them is a doctor herself, lost her from a virus, she cannot, she can taste very little or smell very little.   and it is slowly coming back, so who knows whats happening. i cant say that, you know, uh what i said is having physicians spend more time on oneonone and to keep up your load and perhaps another thing is the pharmacy, but the drug companies are pushing too many pills too quickly on people and influencing their mind over body to think that they need all of these medications, and i think that less is better.   and being active and uh, doing, having a full life is more important than stuff, you know, all the pills are not going to make you feel well. they can take it under control but you need more than a pill for every need.   okay.   thank you very much.   same here",1,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health

127,127,304,145,"   so, youre probably drawing the conclusion as i am that finances plays a big part of my life and of course when i go to my computer in the morning and in the afternoon, lets put pc in here i am checking out the internet site of various experts and i believe that some are factual experts and not trying to sell me something as a result uh, with a fast line, you know, fast and easy money and i also set up, and this has been mostly during the past six weeks, what i call watch lists.   and, my plan is when i get back home, im going to set up a watch, a couple of watch lists with what ive chosen so as to compare it with the company that ive gone to who are going to set up for me a portfolio that they like and which their vicepresident in charge of portfolio advisory services spoke to me about yesterday. and im going to give that six months. so, if i come out nearly as well as they do, goodbye to them and, you know, ill have something to do. i look upon it as a hands on activity   its something ive gained skill at in the past five to eight, yeah, five to eight years and also amount of skill during the past six weeks. so, if you want some help in investing your money i can give you an overview, not an experts view, but an amateurs.   okay. um, so, want to get back to the health situation, do you?   oh okay.   okay, after supper, which i will frequently take in my easy chair which is directly where the uh, t the uh, television set is in direct line, ill watch the news. ill watch wheel of fortune and ill watch two onehour programs.   and, that brings me to ten oclock. sometimes, ill go to eleven oclock and i pay for that. if i don?t start tapering off at ten oclock i pay for it the next day. so, whats happening right now was a result of my going to bed at eleven oclock last night.   i most likely will pay for it sometime this afternoon.   because i, you know i feel that there is a degree of adrenaline flowing uh, during this particular conversation.   and uh, i feel youre a good listener, youre a sympathetic listener and i think that?s what a lot of doctors need.   i would say, yeah,",0,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
128,128,305,145,"   well, go ahead.   yeah.   okay. the very first diagnosed condition for which um, medication was prescribed was valium.   now, as it turns out, valium and artane which is a psychiatric drug   the drugs of choice for relaxing the muscles caused by torticollis and torticollis is a short muscle on one side or the other. on the neck. um, another medication is remeron, which was prescribed for assisting in sleep.   oh yes, im going to have to interject at this moment, um, gosh if ithis is going to open up a whole ball of wax.   so let me, let me list the medications and then ill go back.   so, after the remeron comes cymbalta   and i asked for that medication because it had been given to me two or three years ago and had disastrous effects, but i noticed that it did have beneficial effects in diminishing arthritic pain.   wow! okay, it came after withdrawal from valium   and, i had been on valium for years. so, there may have been a withdrawal effect. the amount of cymbalta that i was taking was sixty milligrams after an initial week of taking thirty milligrams.   when i got to the sixty milligram, i was just not me.   i didn?t feel right.   previous, originally?   um, okay ive got to open that   ball of wax. when i first came to charles uh, to summerville some nine years, nine years ago from columbia where i had worked several years for the state. i became a patient of a d.o.   an internal medicine office. and, this d.o. was treating me as a doctor of internal medicine would treat me.   as i found out from one of the staff persons, when i called up to check his certification, hes got his certification for internal medicine. well anyway he took me off valium and that took about three or four months and then as a replacement, he put me on i dont know what kind of medication and cymbalta.  and, he told me if this doesnt work for you im going to have to send you to a psychiatrist. i didn?t like the idea at all.   well having to go to a psychiatrist?   um, i had gone through therapy before   when i burned out while in education. i went through therapy again when i was working in yosemite national park and i had a flareup of torticollis,",0,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
129,129,306,145,"   okay, um, yeah the, okay going back to the d.o., he took me off the valium.   he put me on another medication, one that i cannot recall. he put me on sixty milligrams of cymbalta, which just sent me for a loop, told me if it didn?t work, he would send me to a psychiatrist. it didn?t work   so, he sent me to a psychiatrist.   yeah.   right.   uh, the very first experience was when i burned out.   while teaching.   and, the second was when i was working in yosemite national park   as, as a maid vacuuming and the vacuuming actually tightened up the muscles and caused muscle, muscle spasm.   so, i may have been conditioned to believe that it was psychologically cause.   so, i sought out psychotherapy.   so, those were instances of psychotherapy rather than psychiatry, but going to this psychiatrist right here now, you know has been a blessing in disguise and that it manageshe manages my medication.   hes aware the valium is for the muscular condition   but, also recently, its also an antianxiety bit, you know with all the financial   upheaval?   yeah. but, im not taking any more than what hes prescribing regardless how i feel.   mmm hmm.   oh, okay. the burnout was a accompanied by chiropractic treatment and im the one who asked for the chiropractic treatment and ive got to open up a vista on my life   where, for some twenty five years i was a member of a teaching brother or a religious order of teaching brothers, the male counterpart to a nun.   that was a great experience when i look back on it.   oh okay. from nineteen fifty five to nineteen seventy six.   thats way back in my past. and so, at the time that i was experiencing burnout, i was teaching four or five periods of english. well, uh, i was one of the newly assigned teachers to a new school.   which began with two classes, then went up three, four, et cetera so, when i started out there, um, i was assigned a full load of teaching five classes. i asked to become the debate coach. i asked to coach uh, freshman basketball.   and, the principle asked me to be athletic director.   oh, i should say because after four years, well i was athletic director maybe two years   after my fourth year of being a debate coach,",0,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
130,130,307,145,"   have we strayed?   okay. um, i want to go back to that d.o. because what i experienced with him is something that any medical student does not want to do. all appointments were scheduled for thirty minutes. fifteen minutes of conversation orby himor talk about his situation, anything whatsoever fifteen minutes of medical examination or whatever, but it was mostly medical talk   he never ever touched me. uh, im a sixtyyear cancer survivor.   prostate cancer for which i had radiation.   yep. two thousand two. august two thousand two. he never checked on my lymph nodes or you know lymph glands in my neck sound in my back, put the stethoscope to my back, to my chest. never checked me, never touched me anywhere else except once. when i landed in the hospital one morning after an episode of atrial uh, atrial fib, he came to me and he massaged my feet.   yep, uh, no, not, the d.o.    i got a bring up a couple other instances.   on one occasion, we were talking about my weight and uh, i may have been just about the weight i am right now and i may have mentioned i feel overweight and he says well yes look at your belt its in the last hole. now you don?t i in my opinion   you don?t diagnose or comment on a persons weight on the basis of where hes wearing his belt. the belt was smaller than this one.   uh, on another occasion, we were talking, i asked him a question, his response was a zinger. youre testing me. i don?t recall what i had asked. i cannot fathom his response. toward the end of my seeing him over a three or four year period, he started not scheduling me for other visits so that i would have to take the initiative and right now im at the point where i have not seen him for eighteen months and i don?t plan to go back to see him because of his way that he interacts or interacted with me, his lengthy conversations, his lack of checking on certain things that i felt were necessary to be checked. he knew i had been through radiation   for, uh, prostate cancer",0,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health

199,199,318,149,"   everything i had to learn to take care of myself rather than depending just on the medical people.   no, the first diagnosis was uh, auto immune hepatitis.   then he sent me to temple, this was in wilmington, delaware. the doctor said well your not reacting like you should so he sent me to temple. the guy in temple said it was primary biliary cirrhosis and, uh, and then he sent me back to the one who made the wrong diagnosis but he made a remark when i was in to see him and i dont even remember the doctors name that i didnt like but he said, ""whats he done now?""   yes. yes, yes. uh, unfortunately, i dont think the average person learns uh, to take you know responsibility unless something like what happened to me happens. i think you are inclined to just let the doctor handle everything. i think that?s a mistake. i don?t it is even helpful to the doctor. uh. but a patient does have, i think it would be more helpful if the patient took some responsibility.   and keep better informed. i, when i was sick i kept a diary.   and uh, i know this, my husband got diagnosed with stage i cancer of the larynx and in there they tell you to keep a diary.   i sincerely doubt that he will because he is one that goes in and whatever the doctor says.   he just does it. i just, it blows me away because if you don?t tell them things they don?t know if its not working or if you are having a problem. i think, you sort of tie the doctors hands by you not taking some of the responsibility of your treatment.   it made me very aware of what was going on. like i had liver disease, you get leg cramps. um, i told the doctor and he says you know there is an old malaria medicine that works, quinine   and uh, so he prescribed it. well it stopped the leg cramps and i got to, then he said will you please go to a support group and i said why? he said not for you, for them. and they were, in their support group they would complain and if he said did you tell your doctor, no, they didn?t want to bother him.   at which point i usually say look you idiot. at what youre paying bother him.   yeah, he went in there, i uh, and he, he said something to me,",0,experience with health and wellbeing,health and wellbeing,health
